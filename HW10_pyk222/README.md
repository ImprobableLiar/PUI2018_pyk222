## Homework 10 Assignment 1

Finished in-class lab and gave explanations on the log-likelihood ratios, tested for y2 as well, did log-likelihood tests comparing linear and polynomial fits. Did everything here. 

## Homework 10 Assignment 2

I did everything here, although with a few hints on syntax. Linda gave me a hint on instead of plotting with loglog=True, which I had an issue, use pl.loglog instead to plot log functions.

For Chi-squared I try to code it judging from the slack general help. 

Created chloropleth map of units and energy, then plot the units and energy through log space: Plot with Units vs Energy and Energy Vs Units, then fit linear and polynomial fits through them, explaining the R-squared and log-likelihood values of both, create chisq and error calculations, as well as graphing them, comparing the models, and doing a likelihood-ratio test like I did in Assignment 1, with linear vs polynomial models.
