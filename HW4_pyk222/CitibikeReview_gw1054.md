# Hypothesis Formulation
I believe that the hypothesis are formulated correctly

# Data Verification
The data has the correct features to answer the question

But I believe that the data representation is not appropriate

because the bar chart only showed the count of trips for two user groups, instead of the average of trip duration for each user group, as stated in the null hypothesis

# Statistical Test
The independent variable is the type of the user, subscriber or customer

The dependent variabel is the average trip duration

The goal is to testing whether there is a difference between the means of two samples

t test should be used to test this hypothesis
