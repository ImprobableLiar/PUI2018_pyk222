pyk227's plot:
![](plot.png)

This static line plot of traffic volume has a nice, clean aesthetic with clear, useful labels. It properly places the date variable on the x axis and does not distort the y axis. There is no chart junk to distract the viewer, and the plot effectively conveys the data with no unnecessary manipulation to confuse or mislead the viewer. 

The plot is small, and some viewers may have difficulty seeing detail or label text. One improvement would involve enlarging the plot slightly. One additional improvement would involve emphasizing the data, perhaps by comparing volumes at other times of day, to tell the story behind it.
