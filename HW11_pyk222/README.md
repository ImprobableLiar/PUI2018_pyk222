I had emailed Professor Bianco for an extension of this Homework. 

## Homework 11 Assignment 1

I want to say I did everything myself here, but I had used the stack overflow and slack so liberally that I can't say I didn't depend on it. I did ask for some syntax hints from a few classmates, but they all point me out to the stack overflow syntax solutions online. 

The Assignment utilizes two kernels: I first booted it up in the ADS kernel and did part one of the assignment, which is to graph card swipes of stations and ride types in natural and log space and derive from that. Part 2 I commented out the train-test split in sklearn and switched the kernel to PUI Python 3. Part 2 I first tried to create fractional change of the quantity using the formula from here: https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/F/F02495.html. But it became hard to see the trends and its smoothing, so I just see each ridetype by its swipes instead, and smoothed it out with rolling mean. (Rolling mean utilizes Python 3.) And from there I picked out the steepest trend(s). Part 3 has been where I called for an extension. I normalized the ridetype based on the 4 features to test and tested it. 

## Homework 11 Assignment 2

I did everything myself here. I got comments for the previous graph, and not much suggestions other than to either get rid of the legend or add more plots to it. So I did the latter.
